Adapters for connecting to evaluation suites.

These adapters allow the incident lab to scan for similar vulnerabilities
across existing evaluation infrastructure.

# In production, these would import from actual evaluation repos:
# from agentic_misuse_benchmark import MisuseBenchmark
# from safeguards_stress_tests import StressTestRunner
# from agentic_safeguards_simulator import SafeguardsSimulator

# For this prototype, blast_radius.py uses simulated results.
